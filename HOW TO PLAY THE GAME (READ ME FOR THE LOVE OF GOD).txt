OK SO THIS MOD IS KIND HACKY CAUSE I WANTED IT TO MOUNT EPISODIC CONTENT AND I FOUND A WAY TO DO IT WITHOUT
NEEDING EPISODE 1 BUT YOU GOTTA LAUNCH IT IN A SHITTY WAY

so to run this mod, go to steam library > tools.

Install Source SDK Base 2013 singleplayer
go to it's properties (right click)
go to betas
set it to upcoming
now go back to the first tab, and in launch options put 
"-game [pathtoefg4]"
the path is usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\efg4
make sure u wrap quotes around the path

run sdk base 2013 singleplayer and if all went well it SHOULD launch have fun
